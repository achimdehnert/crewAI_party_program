Housing in major German cities, particularly those that are modern and globally connected, faces several critical issues:

1. **Affordability**:
   - **Rising Rents**: Major cities such as Berlin, Munich, and Frankfurt have seen significant increases in rental prices over the past few years. This is largely due to high demand and limited supply.
   - **Gentrification**: Many neighborhoods are undergoing gentrification, leading to the displacement of long-term residents who can no longer afford the increased rents.
   - **Income Disparity**: The gap between wages and housing costs is widening, making it difficult for average earners to afford decent housing.

2. **Homelessness**:
   - **Increasing Numbers**: There has been a noticeable rise in homelessness in major cities, driven by factors such as rising rents, unemployment, and lack of affordable housing options.
   - **Support Services**: Cities have various support services and shelters, but the demand often exceeds availability. Initiatives to provide more long-term solutions are ongoing but face bureaucratic and funding challenges.

3. **Living Conditions**:
   - **Quality of Housing**: While new developments often offer high-quality living spaces, many older buildings are in need of renovation. Issues such as inadequate heating, poor insulation, and outdated facilities are common in older housing stock.
   - **Overcrowding**: Due to high costs, many individuals and families are forced to live in overcrowded conditions, which can impact health and quality of life.

4. **Recent Developments and Initiatives**:
   - **Government Policies**: The German government has implemented various policies to address the housing crisis, including rent caps in cities like Berlin, although these measures have faced legal challenges and mixed results.
   - **Construction Projects**: There is a push for increased construction of affordable housing units. However, these projects often face delays due to regulatory hurdles and local opposition.
   - **Public-Private Partnerships**: Some cities are exploring partnerships between the public sector and private developers to expedite the development of affordable housing.
   - **Sustainable Housing**: There is a growing focus on sustainable and energy-efficient housing solutions, aligning with broader environmental goals.

This comprehensive understanding of the current housing situation in major German cities should help in formulating political demands for the Housing domain in a municipal election program for a liberal party. It is crucial to advocate for policies that address both immediate needs and long-term solutions to ensure affordable, quality housing for all residents.

Final Answer: The current state of housing in major German cities is characterized by significant challenges related to affordability, homelessness, and living conditions. Rising rents, gentrification, and income disparity make it difficult for many residents to afford decent housing. Homelessness is on the rise, with support services struggling to meet demand. Living conditions in older housing stock can be poor, and overcrowding is a common issue. Recent developments include government policies like rent caps, increased construction of affordable housing, public-private partnerships, and a focus on sustainable housing solutions. These insights should inform political demands for the Housing domain in a municipal election program for a liberal party.[0m
